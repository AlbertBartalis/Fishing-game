The fishing game is implemented using a data type name “FishingPond” which contains all the necessary members. The game has two mode`s, amateur and pro. The amateur fisherman throws the bait randomly in the fishing pond, meanwhile the professional fisherman try`s to catch fish by throwing the bate in a well determined area.
